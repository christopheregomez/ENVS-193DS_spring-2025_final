repository for ENVS-193DS final
## General information
This repository was created by Chris Gomez and is for the ENVS-193DS final 

The datasets are from: 
Kui, L. 2024. Daily sea surface temperature in Santa Barbara channel between 1982 and 2023 ver 3. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/e930954949b2635928b8be6824630f84. 

Stojanovic et al. (2021). "Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors? A case study of a critically endangered bird." (https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.13319).

Data from: Daily sea surface temperature in Santa Barbara channel between 1982 and 2023

I replicated the data visualiztion from this data set. 

Data from: Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors? 

I addressed this research question by comparing different prediction models, running the models, checking the diagnostics, and selecting the best model to visualize the model prediction. 

## Data and file overview
There are two folders, a code folder and a data folder. All code is in the code folder, and all datasets are in the data folder. 

In the code folder, there is a file called final_TEMPLATE which contains all code for this assignment. The code runs models, generates model predictions, and visualizes data.
